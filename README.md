# BiLSTM and CRF with Fine-Tuned BERT for Named Entity Recognition

## Instruction
- The theory is discussed in [HERE](Explained.pdf).
- to **train** the model, run `train.ipynb`
  - there maybe bugs since I haven't finished

## Features
- **batched** version of official NER provided by `PyTorch` in [HERE](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/advanced_tutorial.html)
- standard training workflow in `PyTorch`
  1. dataset
  2. dataloader
  3. model
  4. train
  5. evaluate
- `BERT` augmented
  - TODO
